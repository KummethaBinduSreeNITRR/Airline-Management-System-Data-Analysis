The airline company has been providing seamless services, ensuring high safety and increased business profitability. However, it now faces challenges from increased competition, rising fuel and operational costs, technological advancements, increasing labor expenses, and evolving environmental guidelines. 
These direct and indirect factors are affecting the company's profitability. To address these issues, the company seeks to reduce costs and increase occupancy rates by focusing on key direct factors such as occupancy rate, revenue from ticket sales, flight frequency and routes, and operational efficiency.
Additionally, indirect factors like customer satisfaction and loyalty, market trends, and seasonality must be considered. By performing comprehensive data analysis, valuable insights can be drawn to inform strategic actions, helping the company navigate these challenges effectively.
